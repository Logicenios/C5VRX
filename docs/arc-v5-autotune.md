# ARC V5 AUTOTUNE

ARC V5 keeps the proven ARC V3 controller as its safety floor and adds a
persistent, confidence-gated feed-forward model.

The goal is **faster reaction without faster hunting**.

## What is learned

For each vendor gain region V5 stores the measured short-horizon response to a
+1 gain step:

- dP/dG
- dQ/dG
- dOrigin/dG
- dClip/dG
- observed settling time
- sample count / confidence

The learned values are **not a distance table**. They describe the receiver's
local actuator response. Transitions that look dominated by an RF fade,
blocker, no-carrier state, or severe clipping are rejected from learning.

## Persistence

The model is stored in NVS under the `arc_v5/model` blob with:

- version
- vendor gain-table fingerprint
- generation counter
- CRC

Writes are rate limited to at most once per minute and only after multiple
accepted learning updates. A changed vendor gain table invalidates the stored
model automatically.

## Safety rules

1. NO_CARRIER never trains the model.
2. Diagnostics/manual gain own the actuator because V5 only ticks while AGC is ACTIVE.
3. Wrong-direction predictive moves can roll back during VERIFY.
4. Low-confidence regions fall back to the existing ARC V3 behavior.
5. The live 40 MS/s path remains hardware paced; V5 runs only on completed control windows.

## Factory calibration

The measured ladder from ARC V3 hardware work remains a low-confidence prior:

```text
G16 -> G40 -> G54 -> G70 -> G78 -> G81
```

It helps recovery before the receiver has learned its own local response, but
only real hardware transitions build confidence for larger predictive jumps.
